## Basic JS Map - ArcGIS API for JavaScript 4.9 for 2D and 3D Maps with REST API

This ArcGIS API for JavaScript map consists of home button, scale bar, search widget, basemap gallery, legend, and map layer widget. This code allows you to insert ArcGIS REST API for more than one layer of feature services or map services on both 2D and 3D maps. These codes are modified from ArcGIS Developer - [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/index.html). 

The REST API for feature services are linked throguh ESRI [Living Atlas](https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/en/) posted by [esri_demographics](https://www.arcgis.com/home/search.html?q=owner%3Aesri_demographics&start=1&sortOrder=true&sortField=relevance#content) and [lisa_berry](https://www.arcgis.com/home/search.html?q=owner%3Alisa_berry&restrict=false&start=1&sortOrder=true&sortField=relevance). You may replace the URLs for feature services REST API with map services REST API.
